# Balance Board - micro:bit Project

## Summary

The Balance Board is a micro:bit game that uses the 3-axis accelerometer to detect board tilt. Utilizing the LED matrix the tilt is represented by one lit LED offset from the center by the amount of the tilt.

The idea is to replicate something like a ball rolling around on a plate you are holding.
